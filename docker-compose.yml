#Docker Compose
# - is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
# - define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment.
# - get an app running in one command by just running docker-compose up
#-----------
# So now, to build the stack, go back to the terminal window, make sure you're in your build directory, and issue the command:
#sudo docker-compose up
#-----------
# The above command will deploy both the web and db containers. If you only run that command, the containers will deploy in attached mode, 
# so you won't get your bash prompt returned. If you want to run them in detached mode, you'd issue the command:
#sudo docker-compose up -d


#what i did understand this
# Composer executa multiplos servi√ßos "containers"
# Dockerfile instala e configura

#version:'3' <-- this is wrong

#version: '3' <-- this is correct.
